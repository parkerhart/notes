Trunk is a simple, web-based notes app that stores notes as Markdown.

Try it out at [TryTrunk.com](http://trytrunk.com/), or follow the instructions below to self-host.

## Installation

Trunk is a regular Rails app and is therefore pretty straight forward to set up.
It requires Ruby 2.2 and prefers Postgres, although other databases should
work too.

### Set up the database

Go into `config/` and copy `database.yml.postgres` to `database.yml` and edit
as required, or create your own `database.yml` config from scratch.

### Create a user

By default Trunk does not allow users to sign up from the web interface. To
enable this, set an environmental variable `ENABLE_SIGNUP` to true and restart.

If you do not wish to enable registration, you should use the built in rake task
to create a user:

    rake users:create

## Development

Contributions are always welcome. If you introduce a new feature, please write
tests for it. Trunk uses Cucumber for integration tests.
